# powerbi-client-vue-js
Power BI Vue component. This library enables you to embed Power BI reports, dashboards, dashboard tiles, report visuals, Q&A or paginated reports in your Vue application, and to create new Power BI reports directly in your application.

## Quick Start

### Import
*Import the 'PowerBIReportEmbed' inside your target module:*
```ts
import { PowerBIReportEmbed } from 'powerbi-client-vue-js';
```

### Embed a Power BI report
```ts
<PowerBIReportEmbed
    :embedConfig = {{
        type: "report",
        id: "<Report Id>",
        embedUrl: "<Embed Url>",
        accessToken: "<Access Token>",
        tokenType: models.TokenType.Embed,
        settings: {
            panes: {
                filters: {
                    expanded: false,
                    visible: false
                }
            },
            background: models.BackgroundType.Transparent,
        }
    }}

    :cssClassName = { "reportClass" }

    :phasedEmbedding = { false }

    :eventHandlers = {
        new Map([
            ['loaded', () => console.log('Report loaded');],
            ['rendered', () => console.log('Report rendered');],
            ['error', (event) => console.log(event.detail);]
        ])
    }
>
</PowerBIReportEmbed>
```

### How to [bootstrap a PowerBI report](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/overview/powerbi/bootstrap-better-performance):
```ts
<PowerBIReportEmbed
    :embedConfig = {{
        type: "report",
        id: undefined,
        embedUrl: undefined,
        accessToken: undefined, // Keep as empty string, null or undefined
        tokenType: models.TokenType.Embed,
        hostname: "https://app.powerbi.com"
    }}
>
</PowerBIReportEmbed>
```

__Note__: To embed the report after [bootstrapping](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/overview/powerbi/bootstrap-better-performance), update the embedConfig (with at least accessToken and embedUrl).

## Embedding other Power BI artifacts
The library offers the following components that can be used to embed various Power BI artifacts.

|Component|Selector to use for embedding|
|:------|:------|
|PowerBIReportEmbedComponent|```<PowerBIReportEmbed>```|
|PowerBIDashboardEmbedComponent|```<PowerBIDashboardEmbed>```|
|PowerBITileEmbedComponent|```<PowerBITileEmbed>```|
|PowerBIVisualEmbedComponent|```<PowerBIVisualEmbed>```|
|PowerBIQnaEmbedComponent|```<PowerBIQnaEmbed>```|
|PowerBIPaginatedReportEmbedComponent|```<PowerBIPaginatedReportEmbed>```|
|PowerBICreateReportEmbedComponent|```<PowerBICreateReport>```|
<br>

You can embed other artifacts such as:
```ts
<PowerBIDashboardEmbed
    :embedConfig = "<IDashboardEmbedConfiguration>"
    :cssClassName = "<className>"
    :eventHandlers = "<Map of String and eventHandler>"
>
</PowerBIDashboardEmbed>
```
### Demo

This demo includes a Vue application that embeds a sample report using the _PowerBIReportEmbed_ component.<br/>
It demonstrates the complete flow from bootstrapping the report, to embedding and updating the embedded report.<br/>
It also demonstrates using the *powerbi report authoring* library, by enabling the user to change the type of visual from a report using the "Change visual type" button.<br />
It also sets a 'DataSelected' event.

<br />
To run the demo on localhost, run the following command:

```
npm run demo
```

Redirect to http://localhost:3000/ to view in the browser.

### Usage
|Use case|Details|
|:------|:------|
|Embed Power BI|To embed your powerbi artifact, pass the component with at least type, embedUrl and accessToken in embedConfig property.|
|Apply style class|Pass the name(s) of style classes to be applied to the embed container div to the cssClassName property.|
|Set event handlers|Pass a map object of event name (string) and event handler (function) to the _eventHandlers_ prop. <br/>__Key__: Event name <br/>__Value__: Event handler method to be triggered<br/>Event handler method takes two optional parameters:<br/>*First parameter*: Event<br/>*Second parameter*: Reference to the embedded entity <br /><br /> List of supported events is given here: [Additional events](#supported-events)|
|Reset event handlers|To reset event handler for an event, set the event handler's value as null in the eventHandlers map of properties.|
|Bootstrap Power BI|To [bootstrap your powerbi entity](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/overview/powerbi/bootstrap-better-performance), pass the property *embedConfig* to the component without _accessToken_<br/>__Note__: _embedConfig_ should at least contain __type__ of the powerbi entity being embedded. <br/>Available types: "report", "dashboard", "tile", "visual" and "qna".<br/>Refer to _How to bootstrap a report_ section in [Quick Start](#quick-start). <br /><br />__Note__:  A paginated report cannot be bootstrapped.|
|Using with PowerBI Report Authoring|1. Install [powerbi-report-authoring](https://www.npmjs.com/package/powerbi-report-authoring) as an npm dependency.<br>2. Use the report authoring APIs using the embedded report's instance.|
|Phased embedding (Report type only)|Set the phasedEmbedding property value to `true` <br/> Refer to the [Phased embedding article](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/overview/powerbi/phased-embedding).|
|Create report|To create a new report, pass the component with at least _type_, _embedUrl_ and _datasetId_ in _embedConfig_ prop.|

<br />

__Note__: Supported browsers are _Edge_, _Chrome_,  and _Firefox_.
<br />

<br />

### Event Handler to be used with Map
```ts
type EventHandler = (event?: service.ICustomEvent<any>, embeddedEntity?: Embed) => void | null;
```

## Using supported SDK methods for Power BI artifacts
### Import
*Import the 'PowerBIReportEmbed' inside your targeted component file:*
```ts
import { PowerBIReportEmbed } from 'powerbi-client-vue-js';
```

### Initialize inside the Component
Component will emit report-obj and You can use this variable.Add method in the component template.
```ts
<PowerBIReportEmbed v-if="isEmbedded"
    :embed-config="sampleReportConfig"
    :phased-embedding="phasedEmbeddingFlag"
    :css-class-name="reportClass"
    :event-handlers="eventHandlersMap"
    @report-obj="setReportObj">
</PowerBIReportEmbed>
```
Declare a variable ```report!:Report``` and set the report to the report-obj.
```ts
setReportObj(value: Report) {
    this.report = value;
},
```

### Use
You can use ```report``` to call supported SDK APIs.
```ts
async getReportPages(): Page[] {
    const pages = await this.report.getPages();
    console.log(pages);
}
```
